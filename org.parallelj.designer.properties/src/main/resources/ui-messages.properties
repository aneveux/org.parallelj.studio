help_color=Here you can pick a new color for the selected element.
help_name=Here you can specify a new name for the selected element.
help_description=Here you can specify a description for the selected element.
help_type=Here you can specify a type for the selected element.
help_capacity=Here you can specify a capacity for the selected element. Please note -1 is used as infinite.
help_executable=Here you can specify an executable to be used by the selected element.
help_join=Here you can specify the join type you want to use: AND, OR, XOR.
help_split=Here you can specify the split type you want to use: AND, OR, XOR.
help_iterable=Here you can select an iterable data to be linked with the selected element.
help_outputlinks=Here are the output links of the selected element. You can re-order them using this part of the view.
help_procedures=Here are the procedures linked to the selected element. You can manage them using this part of the view.
help_predicate=Here you can specify the predicate to be linked with the selected element.
help_execution_mode=Here you can specify the execution mode you want to use: PARALLEL, ITERATIVE, STREAM

tooltip_and_join=AND join allows to wait for all incoming links.
tooltip_or_join=OR join allows to wait for the first activated incoming link.
tooltip_xor_join=XOR join allows to wait for all the activated incoming links.
tooltip_and_split=AND split allows to activate all the outgoing links.
tooltip_or_split=OR split allows to activate one or more outgoing links following a predicate.
tooltip_xor_split=XOR split allows to activate one or more outgoing links (or a default one) following a predicate.
tooltip_selected_color=Selected color is RGB(%d,%d,%d).
tooltip_color_disabled=Changing the color of the selected element is not allowed.
tooltip_parallel_execution_mode=Parallel execution mode allows to execute a loop using multiple threads. It activates parallel execution, so by extension, it can't manage the element's order
tooltip_iterative_execution_mode=Iterative execution mode allows to execute a loop using only one thread. It deactivates parallel execution, but keeps security during execution.
tooltip_stream_execution_mode=Stream execution mode allows to execute a loop using multiple threads using cascade execution. It activates parallel execution, but allows to keep the element's order while processing.

pattern_link=%s ------> %s

error_cast_int=The specified value for the capacity should be an integer. You can use -1 to specify the infinite value.
